Data-Driven Chemistry is a collection of learning material for an introductory Python course for undergraduate chemistry students. The presented material here serves as a public version of [Data-Driven Chemistry](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxchem08031.htm) as taught at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Chemistry.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Python programming language, and requires Python >= 3.9.

Units are written and available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Units will require different packages from the scientific Python ecosystem. The easiest way to install dependencies is using the Anaconda distribution, otherwise the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file also summarises the needed packages. 

## Authors and their contributions:

- James Cumby (JC)

Authors are listed in alphabetical order; specific contributions by each author are found in the following: James Cumby (JC), Valentina Erastova (VE), Claire L. Hobday (CLH), and Antonia Mey (ASJSM) have been teaching this course at the University of Edinburgh since the academic year 2021/22. See below for their detailed contributions. Rafał Szabla (RS) taught one unit and created content for it in 2020/21, when the course was run in a shortened form as a replacement for physical chemistry laboratory practicals during the pandemic. Matteo T Degiacomi (MTD) shared materials, developed in 2018 for his course at Durham University aimed at chemistry research students from which material was adapted. He made some additional contributions beyond his original material.

JC: Is the course organiser for the module taught at the University of Edinburgh and created the material for Unit_01, Unit_10 and the helper_functions, gave feedback on other materials, and helped edit the manuscript.
MTD: Contributed material to Unit_03, Unit_05 and Unit_08, and helped edit the manuscript.
VE: Created material for Unit_05 and Unit_08, contributed to Unit_06, and helped edit the manuscript.
JJG: Contributed material to Unit_09, and helped edit the manuscript.
CLH: Created material for Unit_03 and Unit_04, and helped edit the manuscript.
ASJSM: Created material for Unit_02, Unit_06, Unit_07, and Unit_09, provided feedback and small contributions to most other units, and wrote the manuscript.
HP: Contributed material to Unit_05 and  Unit_08, and helped edit the manuscript.
RS: Created the material for molecular geometries forming part of Unit_06 and gave feedback on the manuscript.

## Acknowledgements
